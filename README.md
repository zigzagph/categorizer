## General Info
This application started from the typical create-react-app template. It has morphed into an application that will open a pdf file (bank statement), parse the account activity, then display that data in a table. From there each debt can be selected and properly categorized into its appropriate tax deduction category (Travel, Meals & Entertainment, Other). The categories are then displayed in a table which then can be saved as a pdf. Its basically an itemizer for your bank statements (Bank of Amer only.)

To run the server run `npm start`.

To run the api server run `npm run serv`.
